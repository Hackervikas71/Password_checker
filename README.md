# Password_checker
This Python script is a password strength checker that evaluates the strength of a user's password based on several criteria. The script defines a function check_password_strength that assesses the password's length, inclusion of digits, uppercase and lowercase letters, and special characters. It also checks for common patterns or sequences. Based on these assessments, the function returns a feedback message indicating whether the password is strong, medium, or weak.

The script also includes a password_checker function that provides a user interface for entering passwords and receiving feedback. The user can enter passwords repeatedly until they type 'exit' to quit the program. The main script runs the password_checker function when executed.

The script aims to help users create stronger passwords by providing clear and actionable feedback on their password choices.
